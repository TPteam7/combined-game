# Escape the Labverse 🧪🚀🔬

**Escape the Labverse** is a combined web-based game project developed for CST-461: Senior Project. It brings together three educational escape room games—**LabLockdown**, **Biology Escape Room**, and **Astronomy Escape**—into one unified hub.

## 🌟 Project Overview

The primary goal of this project was to explore how AI-powered chatbots (like ChatGPT and Gemini) perform as development assistants in the context of game design and implementation. Each team member created a unique educational escape room game focused on a different science topic. We tested AI chatbots for assistance in coding, design feedback, debugging, and workflow optimization throughout the development process.

## 🤖 Research Focus

This project also served as a research study to evaluate AI chatbot effectiveness in the software development lifecycle. We rated AI responses using a Likert scale based on accuracy, helpfulness, and usability. Our findings will be presented alongside the project to highlight the strengths and limitations of current AI development tools in real-world scenarios.
